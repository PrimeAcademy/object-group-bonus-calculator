// Take small steps! Don't write a for loop and two functions that do all of the calculations right away.
// This problem is massive! Break the problem down. Use the debugger.
// What is the fewest lines of code I can write and test to get just a little closer?

// This is not a race. Everyone on your team should understand what is happening.
// Ask questions when you don't.
